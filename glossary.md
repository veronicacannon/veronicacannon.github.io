## Persistence
State preserved when program quits and restarts.

## Recursion
A recursive algorithm must:
1. Have a base case; an escape clause from the function
2. Change its state and move toward base case
3. Call itself recursively

## Algorithm
An algorithm is a step by step list of instructions to solve a problem.  
Basic instructions:
* input
* output
* math and logic
* conditional execution
* repetition

## Resource
A URN is similar to a person's name, while a URL is like a street address. The URN defines something's identity, while the URL provides a location. Essentially, "what" vs. "where". A URN has to be of this form <URN> ::= "urn:" <NID> ":" <NSS> where <NID> is the Namespace Identifier, and <NSS> is the Namespace Specific String.

To put it differently:

        A URL is a URI that identifies a resource and also provides the means of locating the resource by describing the way to access it
        A URL is a URI
        A URI is not necessarily a URL
